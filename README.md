# Personal Library API

This application implements a RESTful API for interacting with a PostgreSQL database representing a small library.

## How It Works

Built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, the API facilitates creation, editng, and deleting of book, series, and author records into a relational database and supports a query to report the user's yearly reading statistics (e.g. most popular genre, most read author, etc.).
